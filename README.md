### Wordle Mini (Thirdle)

📝 This is an attempt to make a simplified version of the popular word game, Wordle, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

🛠 There will be a 3x3 grid in which the user's guess will be displayed.

✍️ User guess can be entered using key presses or by clicking the on-screen keyboard.

⭐️ Letters that are correct will be displayed green, those that are in the wrong place will be yellow, and incorrect letters will be dark grey.
